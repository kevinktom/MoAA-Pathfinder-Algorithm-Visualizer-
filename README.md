MoAA which stands for Museum of Algorithmic Art is a Pathfinder Algorithm Visualizer that showcases the performances of search algorithms, specifically highlighting the efficiency of Dijkstra's Algorithm. Start and end points can be selected by the User, walls can be created to block the traversal to certain nodes, and weights can be added that represent a higher cost of traversing certain nodes. The User is able to select an algorithm and generate a visualization of an algorithm reaching the end point from the start. MoAA is built using vanilla JavaScript and Canvas.js.

## Wireframe
------------
MoAA will have a single page canvas. The User can select the different algorithms on the right panel. The generate button will be used to start the algorithm's search for the end point and the clear button will be used to reset the canvas to a blank one and clear the current maze.

## Architectures and Technologies
---------------------------------
* Vanilla Javascript
* D3 for visualization
* React

## Timeline
-----------
Tuesday - Research D3 and MDN Dom Manipulation and familiarize myself with the searching algorithms

Wednesday - Create the canvas and framework for how the nodes behave

Thursday - Implement functionality of each algorithm

Friday - Create ability for users to create walls and the generate and clear buttons

Weekend - Polish up core functionality and work on bonus features

## Bonus Features
* Allow User to scale the size of the grid/maze
* Add feature of giving nodes weights so that the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm in comparison to the other algorithms
* Add an option for all algorthms to run at the same time
